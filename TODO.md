# TODO LIST

## TODO


- [ ] (游릴TEST) type testing
- [ ] (游릴TEST) increase test coverage
- [ ] (拘FEAT) support async producers, this means that when you get the result you should check if it is a promise
- [ ] (拘뜎ODE) try a better solution instead than no-op patch
- [ ] (拘뜎ODE) enum also for op of json patches
- [ ] (游릱TYPE) better types for json patches
- [ ] (拘FEAT) json patches don't support "" as key if the path is a string ( to solve this, use a placeholder like ___empty___)
- [ ] (拘FEAT) maybe use proxy revocable? maybe not necessary because they are already garbage collected
- [ ] (拘FEAT) "NOTHING" as return, so you can return undefined
- [ ] (拘뜎ODE) add more comments in code
- [ ] (拘뜎ODE) give better names to variables and types
- [ ] (游릶BENC) add benchmarks for patches

## IN PROGRESS

- [ ] (拘뜎ODE) correct the nomenclature and behaviour of the helpers
    - [x] original should always return the original object
    - [ ] target should be renamed to make more understandable what it does
    - [ ] clone should always return the shallow copy of the object or null

## SOLVED
- [x] (拘뜎ODE) split the logic in multiple reusable functions
- [x] (拘뜎ODE) organize the code better in multiple files
- [x] (游릳PERF) turn the proxy trap into a class
- [x] (游릵DOCS) documentate new settings and remove docs for old helpers, write breaking changes
- [x] (游릳PERF) store type in the currData
- [x] (拘FEAT) full compatibility with [this rfc of redux toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3074)
- [x] (游릲BUGS) test fails with both standard patches and auto freeze enabled
- [x] (游릲BUGS) frozen sets caused infinite loops
- [x] (游릴TEST) each test should possibly also run on strict copy and/or auto freeze
- [x] (游릲BUGS) patches don't work with circular references
- [x] (游릴TEST) generate and try patches in every test
- [x] (游릳PERF) dummy objects in freeze should be reused as shallow targets
- [x] (游릳PERF) use object like { [Symbol()]: target } as proxy target
- [x] (游릲BUGS) reverse patches may create inconsistencies in sets
- [x] (游릵DOCS) documentate helpers like original and target
- [x] (拘FEAT) possibility to convert patches in standard RFC JSON format
- [x] (拘FEAT) added support for the "in" operator and ownKeys trap
- [x] (游릱TYPE) Passing a frozen object should never require explicit casting
- [x] (游릱TYPE) produceWithPatches didn't allow a return type different from the draft
- [x] (游릲BUGS) patches could delete an element wrongly with maps
- [x] (游릲BUGS) assign the descriptor value during strict copy, because the descriptor could be a getter or setter
- [x] (游릱TYPE) patches should not be callable for primitive types
- [x] (游릴TEST) add test for symbols in strict mode 
- [x] (游릲BUGS) symbols were not copied on strict copy
- [x] (游릶BENC) add benchmarks for different setups
- [x] (拘FEAT) added patches
- [x] (游릲BUGS) if I have multiple link to a child for the same parent, the append action is only done once

## DISCARDED

- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) maybe use only two proxies instead of creating one each time (undoable because you would lose the target ref)~~
- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) freeze the objects while you draft (not doable because if you have any other modifications it will fail them)~~
- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) turn walk parents into a class (actually I tried and it worsen performance)~~
- ~~[ ] (拘FEAT) maybe implement those types? TypedArray, DataView, File, Blob, FileList, DomException~~
- ~~[ ] (拘FEAT) maybe implement those proxy traps? defineProperty, setPrototypeOF, preventExtensions, apply~~
- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) appended: WeakSet could be used to see if an element was external to the tree, so we could avoid cloning it~~
- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) getOwnPropertySymbols adds some overhead on copy: we could disable it with a flag if necessary. Is it worth?~~
- ~~[ ] (游릳PERF) typeof v is taken two times, the second time for checking if it's a function. Is it worth solving?~~
- ~~[ ] (拘FEAT) allow switching implementations~~
